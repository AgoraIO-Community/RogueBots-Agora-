## About this project
Rogue Bots lite is a top-down shooter game with the goal for the player to survive from the dangerous bots trying to reduce your health. By entering the same channel name and encryption key two players join a game and video chat. It has multiple power gadgets that help you during your game, like using the blue balls you can regain your health while the green balls help you shoot three bullets at a time, the bots keep on respawning and you have to dodge or kill them in order to survive. This is sort of a companion game for the original Rogue Bots game available on steam which was also created by me.
